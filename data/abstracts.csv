In this regard, fuzzy models that consider the investment amount and cost may enable making more realistic decisions rather than the deterministic models used in portfolio optimization (PO). Hence, the objective of this paper is to examine the effects of the environment, investment amount and cost on PO in a politically, socially and economically unstable environment. Konno-Yamazaki PO model was fuzzified by adopting fuzzy linear programming (FLP) approaches of Verdegay and Werners for this purpose. Afterward, extended models were created. To do that, investment amount, tax and transaction costs were integrated into the return constraint of the fuzzified models. Mean-Variance Model (MVM) of Markowitz was also used for comparatively interpreting the results of the optimization. Results show that the fuzzified models based on Verdegay and Werners FLP approaches can be suggested as a decision-making tool, respectively for risk-averse and risk-taker investors. The extended models provide much better results compared to the fuzzified models. On the other hand, they are not more successful than the MVM in an unstable environment but the stable environment. The main contributions are onsidering political, social and economic events in the optimization, comparatively analyzing fuzzified Konno-Yamazaki model with its extended versions and the MVM, investigating the relationship between optimization models and investor types."

In this work, we study whether informational feedback in natural language can be leveraged to improve generation quality and user preference alignment. To this end, we consider factual consistency in summarization, the quality that the summary should only contain information supported by the input documents, for user preference alignment. We collect a high-quality dataset, DeFacto , containing human demonstrations and informational feedback in natural language consisting of corrective instructions, edited summaries, and explanations with respect to the factual consistency of the summary. Using our dataset, we study two natural language generation tasks: 1) editing a summary using the human feedback, and 2) generating human feedback from the original summary. Using the two tasks, we further evaluate if models can automatically correct factual inconsistencies in generated summaries. We show that the human-edited summaries we collected are more factually consistent, and pre-trained language models can leverage our dataset to improve the factual consistency of original system-generated summaries in our proposed generation tasks. We make the DeFacto dataset publicly available at https:// github.com/microsoft/DeFacto ."

Ten healthy volunteers' daily activity (steps) were tracked with Fitbit pedometers. Sagittal MRI T2 maps were obtained in the morning and afternoon on days 2 and 3. Mean T2 values were analyzed for variation related to the number of steps taken (activity), time of day (diurnal variation), and BMI using mixed effect model. Significant (albeit small) differences in the medial femoral and medial tibial cartilage regions were identified between morning and afternoon scans (diurnal variation). Daily activity did not result in significant changes and increasing BMI only demonstrated a slight increase in T2 values for the lateral tibial plateau. These findings suggest that it may be necessary to control diurnal variation when using quantitative MRI T2 mapping to assess articular cartilage longitudinally in healthy participants. Further investigation is needed to confirm these findings and determine if they also apply to symptomatic patients."
5,397919c28fd365fc425ff6763279da8b7b12fb9b,"Why do some peer production projects do a better job at engaging potential contributors than others? We address this question by comparing three Indian language Wikipedias, namely, Malayalam, Marathi, and Kannada. We found that although the three projects share goals, technological infrastructure, and a similar set of challenges, Malayalam Wikipedia’s community engages language speakers in contributing at a much higher rate than the others. Drawing from a grounded theory analysis of interviews with 18 community participants from the three projects, we found that experience with participatory governance and free/open-source software in the Malayalam community supported high engagement of contributors. Counterintuitively, we found that financial resources intended to increase participation in the Marathi and Kannada communities hindered the growth of these communities. Our findings underscore the importance of social and cultural context in the trajectories of peer production communities."

Research has shown that limestone aggregates with high concentrations of carbonates are highly susceptible to polishing. Identifying polish-susceptible aggregates in the laboratory before they are placed on the road surface can help reduce accidents and save lives. Seven aggregate sources from nine field sites throughout Utah were identified by the locked-wheel skid trailer (LWST) to have low friction surfaces. A correlation between carbonate content, determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and accelerated polish testing was developed. Additionally, a correlation between field testing and laboratory testing was developed between the results of XRD and LWST testing. The correlations were characterized by high coefficients of determination, indicating that carbonate content is highly correlated to both polish susceptibility and field friction values. These correlations can be used to help reduce risk to the traveling public and predict pavement friction values before placing new asphalt."

Motivated by the fact that polarization could emerge from the politicization of news content in the media (i.e., framing), this paper uses the universe of articles related to climate change from The Guardian between 2004 and 2018 to estimate the effects of politicization on user engagement. We find that a rise in politicized content is associated with significant increase in user engagement for non-climate change articles, but with a much weaker increase for articles with greater climate change intensity. We furthermore explore the mechanisms behind these results and show that the politicized content of the discussion sections of the articles accounts for the overall effects. Our results suggest that organizations in the digital economy can communicate factual information to consumers better by avoiding politicized rhetoric."

12,29c7cce9b5ab810e200c6e0bba58b75e4552e5b1,"The spread of misinformation online is a global problem that requires global solutions. To that end, we conducted an experiment in 16 countries across 6 continents (N = 33,480) to investigate predictors of susceptibility to misinformation and interventions to combat misinformation. In every country, participants with a more analytic cognitive style and stronger accuracy-related motivations were better at discerning truth from falsehood; valuing democracy was also associated with greater truth discernment whereas political conservatism was negatively associated with truth discernment in most countries. Subtly prompting people to think about accuracy was broadly effective at improving the veracity of news that people were willing to share, as were minimal digital literacy tips. Finally, crowdsourced accuracy evaluation was able to differentiate true from false headlines with high accuracy in all countries. The consistent patterns we observe suggest that the psychological factors underlying the misinformation challenge are similar across the globe, and that similar solutions may be broadly effective."
13,9fafdd2a5ffb7e054ba4820cec514fb3315e3ee0,"Peptide transporters play important nutritional and cell signalling roles in Bacillus subtilis, which are pronounced during stationary phase adaptations and development. Three high-affinity ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family transporters are involved in peptide uptake - the oligopeptide permease (Opp), another peptide permease (App) and a less well-characterized dipeptide permease (Dpp). Here we report crystal structures of the extracellular substrate binding proteins, OppA and DppE, which serve the Opp and Dpp systems, respectively. The structure of OppA was determined in complex with endogenous peptides, modelled as Ser-Asn-Ser-Ser, and with the sporulation-promoting peptide Ser-Arg-Asn-Val-Thr, which bind with K d values of 0.4 and 2 µM, respectively, as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. Differential scanning fluorescence experiments with a wider panel of ligands showed that OppA has highest affinity for tetra- and penta-peptides. The structure of DppE revealed the unexpected presence of a murein tripeptide (MTP) ligand, l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-DAP, in the peptide binding groove. The mode of MTP binding in DppE is different to that observed in the murein peptide binding protein, MppA, from Escherichia coli, suggesting independent evolution of these proteins from an OppA-like precursor. The presence of MTP in DppE points to a role for Dpp in the uptake and recycling of cell wall peptides, a conclusion that is supported by analysis of the genomic context of dpp, which revealed adjacent genes encoding enzymes involved in muropeptide catabolism in a gene organization that is widely conserved in Firmicutes."
14,1ba0822680eba3febabb3c2b648c812cc6514476,"To craft effective public policy, modern governments must gather and analyze data on both the performance of their public functions and the responses by the public. Federal administrative agencies such as the Patent Office and Centers for Disease Control routinely do this, as does the United States Congress. More importantly, they make such data freely accessible. Within the United States government, however, the judicial branch is a conspicuous outlier. In theory, federal court records could be used to evaluate the efficiency and fairness of the justice system. In practice, court records are effectively out of reach because they sit behind a government paywall. This financial barrier, along with an equally important myriad of technical obstacles, have forestalled the development of AI-driven analysis that could enable a systematic understanding and evaluation of the work of the courts.
The Systematic Content Analysis of Litigation EventS Open Knowledge Network (SCALES OKN) seeks to address this situation by transforming the transparency and accessibility of court records. The SCALES OKN will potentiate the development of new AI solutions that will benefit the judiciary, legal scholars, and the public. In this article, we outline some of key financial, technical, and policy challenges to developing novel AI solutions."
15,287d5dcbda5140681e72f345be9b172e52074f6a,"Myxoid degeneration of the cardiac valves is a common feature in a heterogeneous group of disorders that includes Marfan syndrome and isolated valvular diseases. Mitral valve prolapse is the most common outcome of these and remains one of the most common indications for valvular surgery. While the etiology of the disease is unknown, recent genetic studies have demonstrated that an X‐linked form of familial cardiac valvular dystrophy can be attributed to mutations in the Filamin‐A gene. Since these inheritable mutations are present from conception, we hypothesize that filamin‐A mutations present at the time of valve morphogenesis lead to dysfunction that progresses postnatally to clinically relevant disease. Therefore, by carefully evaluating genetic factors (such as filamin‐A) that play a substantial role in MVP, we can elucidate relevant developmental pathways that contribute to its pathogenesis. In order to understand how developmental expression of a mutant protein can lead to valve disease, the spatio‐temporal distribution of filamin‐A during cardiac morphogenesis must first be characterized. Although previously thought of as a ubiquitously expressed gene, we demonstrate that filamin‐A is robustly expressed in non‐myocyte cells throughout cardiac morphogenesis including epicardial and endocardial cells, and mesenchymal cells derived by EMT from these two epithelia, as well as mesenchyme of neural crest origin. In postnatal hearts, expression of filamin‐A is significantly decreased in the atrioventricular and outflow tract valve leaflets and their suspensory apparatus. Characterization of the temporal and spatial expression pattern of filamin‐A during cardiac morphogenesis is a crucial first step in our understanding of how mutations in filamin‐A result in clinically relevant valve disease.

Si esta transformacion ha resultado ser positiva o negativa en lo que respecta a la escolarizacion de quienes quedan atras se ha convertido en tema de debate y especulacion. Esta investigacion busca analizar esta cuestion en profundidad a traves del examen del impacto que tienen las remesas financieras en la escolaridad de una comunidad prominente de poblacion emigrante en el sur de Mexico. Se presenta un estudio de casos en cuatro jovenes de este pueblo que se encuentran en edad escolar y que son receptores de remesas por parte de sus padres residentes en los Estados Unidos. Si bien resultan potencialmente utiles para mejorar el rendimiento escolar y los logros academicos, se observa que las remesas no tienen por si mismas el peso suficiente para mejorar los resultados educativos y, en algunos casos, pueden contribuir a que los jovenes partan en la busqueda de caminos alternativos a la escolaridad. La capacidad de las madres para ayudar a sus hijos con las tareas -en funcion de la educacion que ellas mismas hayan recibido- parece ser un factor determinante al momento de tomar esta decision. Tambien se observa que los valores implicitos y explicitos vinculados a la educacion que reciben por parte de los padres ausentes juegan un rol importante en las elecciones academicas que realicen. Se discuten las implicancias de estos hallazgos para el progreso de Mexico en el cumplimiento de los objetivos de la Educacion Para Todos 2015. EnglishAs Mexico assesses its relative success in meeting the Education For All 2015 goals, schooling opportunities in many parts of the nation have been impacted by the international migration phenomenon and the resulting troves of financial capital it receives by way of absent migrants. Whether this transformation has been a net positive or negative in regards to the schooling of those remaining behind has been subject to debate and speculation. This research delves into this question through an examination of the impact of financial remittances on schooling within one prominent migrantsending community in southern Mexico. This paper presents case studies of four in-school youth in the town who receive remittance income from fathers residing in the United States. We find that remittances, while potentially helpful for schooling performance and attainment, are alone not enough to boost educational outcomes and in some cases can contribute to the pursuit of non-schooling pathways for youth. In the presence of remittances, the ability of mothers to aid their children with school related tasks—usually as a result of relatively high educational attainment in their own right—appears to be a critical mediator of these pathways. We also find that the explicit and implicit values regarding education transmitted by absent parents to play a role in subsequent student academic trajectories. The implications of these findings for Mexico’s progress in attaining the Educational For All 2015 goals are discussed."

Not everyone in the world, including Indonesians, views the pandemic in the same way. Analyzing Covid-19 Facebook posts is a good way to gauge public opinion about the pandemic. The goal of this study is to examine public sentiment in Indonesia regarding the Covid-19 disease outbreak by analyzing reactions to Facebook posts, particularly those from verified government accounts, which will be compared to accounts from news portals. With the help of CrowdTangle, 1211 Facebook posts containing the word ""wabah covid-19"" from 10 government officials and 10 news portals were collected between January 21, 2020, and January 21, 2021, for this study. Boxplot and word cloud visualizations, as well as statistical tests, were used to confirm different sentiment in posts by different types of accounts, as well as different public reactions. Posts from government officials, on the other hand, tended to be more positive, whereas posts from news portals tended to be more negative. Furthermore, posts by government officials tended to receive more positive reactions, regardless of their sentiment, compared to posts by news portals, which received a variety of public reactions depending on the sentiment."

In this attack, a chosen keyword or topic is artificially promoted by coordinated and inauthentic activity to appear popular, and, crucially, this activity is removed as part of the attack. We observe such attacks on Twitter trends and find that these attacks are not only successful but also pervasive. We detected over 19,000 unique fake trends promoted by over 108,000 accounts, including not only fake but also compromised accounts, many of which remained active and continued participating in the attacks. Trends astroturfed by these attacks account for at least 20% of the top 10 global trends. Ephemeral astroturfing threatens the integrity of popularity mechanisms on social media platforms and by extension the integrity of the platforms."

The aim of this research is to examine knowledge levels of pre-school teachers about the characteristics of learning difficulties that 3–6 years old students, in the pre-school period, may show. With this aim in mind, the development of the “Test for identifying characteristics of learning disabilities in pre-school students (3-6 years)” was completed with 471 pre-school teachers and pre-school teacher candidates of the last grade of pre-school education program. The research has been done in the survey model with a quantitative approach. The sample of the study consists of 291 pre-school teachers. The data have been collected by means of the “Test for identifying characteristics of learning disabilities in pre-school students (3-6 years)” and analyzed using descriptive statistics techniques. At the end of the research, it has been found that there are no statistically significant differences in knowledge levels of pre-school teachers regarding the cognitive, affective, social and motor characteristics of learning disabilities in terms of their gender, the program they have graduated from, having taken courses on special education, having taken courses on learning disabilities, the types of institutions they worked at, and their class sizes. It has been found that there are statistically significant differences in their knowledge levels about cognitive, affective, social and motor characteristics of learning disabilities according to the length of service, teaching students with learning disabilities, having inclusive students in their class, having a relative in need of special education, and teaching students with learning disabilities variables."

Self-exciting Hawkes processes have been widely adopted for such tasks due to their success in describing cascad-ing behaviors. In this paper, for general, marked Hawkes point processes, we present closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of future event counts, conditioned on observed events. Furthermore, these expressions allow us to de-velop a predictive approach, namely, Cascade Anytime Size Prediction via self-Exciting Regression model (CASPER), which is specifically tai-lored to popularity prediction, unlike existing generative approaches – based on point processes – for the same task. We showcase CASPER’s merits via experiments entailing both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate that it considerably improves upon prior works in terms of accuracy, especially for early-stage prediction."
28,04deee6b53867da25ce6aa3275ab9f06d24b7153,"Several explainable AI methods allow a Machine Learning user to get insights on the classification process of a black-box model in the form of local linear explanations. With such information, the user can judge which features are locally relevant for the classification outcome, and get an understanding of how the model reasons. Standard supervised learning processes are purely driven by the original features and target labels, without any feedback loop informed by the local relevance of the features identified by the post-hoc explanations.In this paper, we exploit this newly obtained information to design a feature engineering phase, where we combine explanations with feature values. To do so, we develop two different strategies, named Iterative Dataset Weighting and Targeted Replacement Values, which generate streamlined models that better mimic the explanation process presented to the user. We show how these streamlined models compare to the original black-box classifiers, in terms of accuracy and compactness of the newly produced explanations."
29,c987f900cb9c3f40a69963d0068a5e7f13587fe5,"Background: Models of collective decision-making typically assume that individuals sample information independently and decide instantaneously. In most natural and sociological settings, however, decisions occur over some timescale in which group members gather information—often from multiple sources. Information sources may persist for varying lengths of time or be viewed concurrently and identically by multiple group members. These tendencies introduce spatio-temporal correlations in gathered information with poorly understood consequences. Research Design: Here, we develop a collective decision-making model in which individuals’ access and switch between two conflicting cues that differ in their spatio-temporal properties. Results: Our model reveals that spatially and temporally correlated cues can profoundly affect collective decisions. Specifically, we observe that spatially correlated cues are dominant when individuals rarely switch between sources of information. Temporally correlated cues, on the other hand, have the strongest impact when individuals frequently switch between information sources. We also discuss how much the usage of independent information must be increased to counter the impact of correlation. Conclusions: The present model represents a first step toward more accurately capturing the complex mechanisms underlying collective decision-making in natural systems and reveals multiple ways in which the properties of environmental cues can impact collective behavior."

Our study investigated the metabolism of MXPr to elucidate the distribution of the parent drug and its metabolites in body fluids and fur of 16 mice. After the intraperitoneal administration of MXPr (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), urine samples from 8 male and 8 female mice were collected every hour for 6 consecutive hours and then at 12-24 hours intervals. Additionally, plasma samples were collected 24 hours after MXPr (1 and 3 mg/kg) administration. Urine and plasma were diluted 1:3 with acetonitrile/methanol (95:5), and directly injected into the UHPLC-QTOF-HRMS system. The phase-I and II metabolites were preliminarily identified by means of the fragmentation patterns and the exact masses of both their precursor and fragment ions. Lastly, the mice fur was analyzed following an extraction procedure specific for the keratin matrix. Desmethyl-MXPr-glucoronide was identified in urine as the main metabolite, detected up to 24 hours after administration. The presence of NorMXPr in urine, plasma and fur was also relevant, following a N-dealkylation process of the parent drug. Other metabolites that were identified in fur and plasma included Desmethyl-MXPr and Dihydro-MXPr. Knowledge of the MXPr metabolites evolution is likely to support their introduction as target compounds in NPS toxicological screening analysis on real samples, both to confirm intake and extend the detection window of the dissociative drug MXPr in the biological matrices."

Using tools from complex network theory, we analyze the early evolution of social structure in four pairs of StackExchange communities, each corresponding to one active and one closed community on the same topic. We adapt the dynamical reputation model to quantify the evolution of social trust in these communities. Our analysis shows that active communities have higher local cohesiveness and develop stable and more strongly connected cores. The average reputation is higher in sustainable communities. In these communities, the trust between core members develops early and remains high over time. Our results imply that efforts to create a stable and trustworthy core may be crucial for building a sustainable knowledge-sharing community."

To address this issue quantitatively, we analyze systems of adaptive traders that choose where to trade based on their previous experience. We demonstrate that only based on aggregate parameters about trading venues, such as the demand-to-supply ratio, we can assess whether a population of traders will prefer fragmentation or specialization towards a single venue. We investigate what conditions lead to market fragmentation for populations with a long memory and analyze the stability and other properties of both fragmented and consolidated steady states. Finally, we investigate the dynamics of populations with finite memory; when this memory is long the true long-time steady states are consolidated but fragmented states are strongly metastable, dominating the behavior out to long times."

Our analysis demonstrates a stark increase in attention to medical preprints among the general public since the beginning of the pandemic. We also observe a political divide in medical preprint sharing patterns - a finding in line with previous observations regarding the politicisation of COVID-19-related discussions. In addition, we find that the increase in attention to preprints from the members of the general public coincided with the change in the social media-based discourse around preprints."

Methods: We monitored gene expression levels in PBMCs from 3 independent cohorts for a total of 297 cases (including clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS, primary and secondary progressive MS) and 96 healthy controls by distinct microarray platforms and quantitative PCR. Differential expression and pathway analyses for distinct MS stages were defined and validated by literature mining. Results: Genes located in the vicinity of MS risk variants displayed altered expression in peripheral blood at distinct stages of MS compared with the healthy population. The frequency of dysregulation was significantly higher than expected in CIS and progressive forms of MS. Pathway analysis for each MS stage–specific gene list showed that dysregulated genes contributed to pathogenic processes with scientific evidence in MS. Conclusions: Systematic gene expression analysis in PBMCs highlighted selective dysregulation of MS susceptibility genes playing a role in novel and well-known pathogenic pathways."

Although social contagion arises as a result of cognitive processes and biases, integration of cognitive mechanisms with the theory of social contagion remains as an open challenge. In particular, studies on social phenomena usually assume contagion dynamics to be either simple or complex , rather than allowing it to emerge from cognitive mechanisms, despite empirical evidence indicating that a social system can exhibit a spectrum of contagion dynamics—from simple to complex —simultaneously. Here, we propose a model of interacting beliefs as a unifying framework, from which both simple and complex contagion dynamics can organically arise. Our model also elucidates how a fundamental mechanism of complex contagion—resistance—can come about from cognitive mechanisms. Our model may oﬀer a unifying framework to study both simple and complex contagion dynamics in social systems."

The dataset is created by aggregating publicly available datasets from the UK Department for Transport, which are drastically imbalanced with missing attributes sometimes approaching 50% of the overall data dimensionality. The paper presents the data analysis pipeline starting from the publicly available data of road trafﬁc accidents and ending with predictors of possible injuries and their degree of severity. It addresses the huge incompleteness of public data with a MissForest model. The paper also introduces two baseline approaches to create injury predictors: a supervised artiﬁcial neural network and a reinforcement learning model. The dataset can potentially stimulate diverse aspects of machine learning research on imbalanced datasets and the two approaches can be used as baseline references when researchers test more advanced learning algorithms in this area."
43,dc1306e6051b0be8256236e83af0d9be8586b5fd,"We propose a novel network epidemic model to elucidate the impact of deniers on the spread of epidemic diseases. Specifically, we study the spread of a recurrent epidemic disease, whose progression is captured by a susceptible–infected–susceptible model, in a population partitioned into two groups: cautious individuals and deniers. Cautious individuals may adopt self-protective behaviors, possibly incentivized by information campaigns implemented by public authorities; on the contrary, deniers reject their adoption. Through a mean-field approach, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold for large-scale homogeneous networks, shedding light onto the role of deniers in shaping the course of an epidemic outbreak. Specifically, our analytical insight suggests that even a small minority of deniers may jeopardize the effort of public health authorities when the population is highly polarized. Numerical results extend our analytical findings to heterogeneous networks."

El OBJETIVO principal es proponer un metodo de valoracion objetiva que permita analizar la interaccion del movimiento del binomio caballo-jinete y su aplicacion como herramienta para valorar y orientar la intervencion en hipoterapia. METODOLOGIA: Mediante un estudio observacional en personas con paralisis cerebral y un grupo control, se relaciona el factor bajo estudio (el movimiento del caballo) y el efecto (la transmision del movimiento al jinete). Se realizo un registro de acelerometria mediante cuatro acelerometros triaxiales ubicados en el jinete y la grupa del caballo, durante una prueba que simula una sesion de hipoterapia. RESULTADOS: Se analizaron 70 registros. Tanto en el analisis en el dominio del tiempo como en el dominio de la frecuencia, se encontraron diferencias significativas en el comportamiento entre ambos grupos. CONCLUSIONES: Montar a caballo lleva implicito una transmision de movimiento del caballo al jinete independientemente de la capacidad de este; las caracteristicas morfologicas del caballo influyen en el movimiento transmitido al jinete; la acelerometria ha demostrado cumplir los requisitos como sistema de valoracion objetivo de utilidad en hipoterapia, ya que la estabilidad de una persona a caballo podria valorarse considerando como indicador el grado de armonizacion entre el movimiento del caballo y el jinete, y por tanto este indicador puede ser de utilidad tanto para la valoracion como para la orientacion de las intervenciones terapeuticas en hipoterapia. EnglishScientific research and clinical practice shows the positive effects hippotherapy in control and postural stability, balance, gait and gross motor function in people with disabilities. The main objective is to propose a method of objective assessment in order to analyze the interaction of the movement of the horse-rider binomial and its application as a tool to assess and guide the intervention in hippotherapy. METHODS: an observational study in people with cerebral palsy and a control group, the factor under study (the movement of the horse) and effect (the transmission of movement to the rider) are relate. A record of accelerometry was performed using four triaxial accelerometers placed on the rider and the horse's group, in a test that simulates a session of hippotherapy. RESULTS: 70 records were analyzed. Both the analysis in the time domain and the frequency domain, significant differences in behavior between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Riding implies a movement transmission horse rider regardless of capacity thereof; Horse morphological characteristics influence the movement transmitted to the rider; accelerometry has proved qualify as a system of objective assessment useful in hippotherapy, as the stability of a person on horseback could be worth considering as an indicator of the degree of harmonization between the motion of the horse and rider, and therefore this indicator can be useful for both the assessment and for the guidance of therapeutic interventions in hippotherapy."

Cities are effective engines of economic growth and prosperity and incubate complex dynamics within their labour market, and the labour markets they support demonstrate considerable diversity. This presents a challenge to policy makers who would like to optimise labour markets to benefit workers, promote economic growth and manage the impact of technological change. While much previous work has studied the economic characteristics of cities as a function of size and examined the exposure of urban economies to automation, this has often been from a static perspective. In this work we examine the structure of city job networks to uncover the diffusive properties. More specifically, we identify the occupations which are most important in promoting the diffusion of beneficial or deleterious properties. We find that these properties vary considerably with city size."

However, there are currently no guidelines for the non-destructive testing (NDT) and evaluation (NDE) of HDPE ASTs. Moreover, the feasibility, limitations, and challenges of using NDT techniques for the field inspection of HDPE ASTs have not been well established. This study used both infrared thermography (IRT) and ultrasonic testing (UT) for the field inspection of HDPE ASTs. Highlighting the implementation challenges in the field, this study determined that: (1) ambient environmental parameters can affect IRT accuracy; (2) there is an ideal time during the day to perform IRT; (3) the heating source and infrared camera orientation can affect IRT accuracy; and (4) with proper measures taken, IRT is a promising method for flaw detection in HDPE ASTs. Additionally, UT can be used following IRT for detailed investigation to quantify the size and depth of defects. The manuscript concludes with a discussion of the limitations and best practices for the implementing of IRT and UT for HDPE AST inspections in the field."

We therefore investigate cross-lingual knowledge transfer strategies to execute this task for clinics that do not use the English language and have a small amount of in-domain data available. Our results reveal two strategies that outperform the state-of-the-art: Translation-based methods in combination with domain-specific encoders and cross-lingual encoders plus adapters. We find that these strategies perform especially well for classifying rare phenotypes and we advise on which method to prefer in which situation. Our results show that using multilingual data overall improves clinical phenotyping models and can compensate for data sparseness."

Current approaches used in the literature for analyzing such data typically employ summary measures such as total inactivity time or compositional metrics. However, at the conceptual level, these methods have the potential disadvantage of discarding important information from recorded data when calculating these summaries and metrics since these typically depend on cut-offs related to intensity exercise zones that are chosen subjectively or even arbitrarily. Much of the data collected in these studies follow complex survey designs, making application of standard statistical tools such as non-parametric regression models inappropriate and the requirement of specific estimation procedures according to particular sampling-design is mandatory. With functional data or other complex objects, barely literature exist that handles complex sampling designs in the statistical analysis. This paper aims two-fold; first, we introduce a new functional representation of accelerometer data of a distributional nature to build a complete individualized profile of each subject’s physical activity levels. Second, using the NHANES accelerometer data (2003-2006), we show the potential advantages of this new representation to predict patients’ outcomes over 68 years of age. A critical component in our statistical modeling is that we extend non-parametric functional models used: kernel smoother and kernel ridge regression, to handle the specific effect of complex sampling design in order to provide reliable conclusions about the influence of physical activity in distinct analysis performed."

The most successful organic materials for applications that rely on charge carrier generation, such as solar cells, utilize blends of several types of molecules. In blends, the local environment strongly influences exciton and charge carrier dynamics. However, relationship between nanoscale features and photophysics is difficult to establish due to the lack of necessary spatial resolution. We use functionalized fluorinated pentacene (Pn) molecule as single molecule probes of intermolecular interactions and of the nanoscale environment in blends containing donor and acceptor molecules. Single Pn donor (D) molecules were imaged in PMMA in the presence of acceptor (A) molecules using wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Two sample configurations were realized: (i) a fixed concentration of Pn donor molecules, with increasing concentration of acceptor molecules (functionalized indenflouorene or PCBM) and (ii) a fixed concentration of acceptor molecules with an increased concentration of the Pn donor. The D-A energy transfer and changes in the donor emission due to those in the acceptor- modified polymer morphology were quantified. The increase in the acceptor concentration was accompanied by enhanced photobleaching and blinking of the Pn donor molecules. To better understand the underlying physics of these processes, we modeled photoexcited electron dynamics using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated blinking dynamics were then compared to our experimental data, and the changes in the transition rates were related to the changes in the nanoscale environment. Our study provides insight into evolution of nanoscale environment during the formation of bulk heterojunctions."

Here, we broaden the scope and depth of previous investigations by considering how DWMs responded to an ongoing pandemic after the initial shock. Our dataset contains listings from 194 DWMs collected until July 2021. We start by focusing on vaccines. We find 248 listings offering approved vaccines, like Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca, as well as vendors offering fabricated proofs of vaccination and COVID-19 passports. Then, we consider COVID-19 related products. We show that, as the regular economy has become able to satisfy the demand of these goods, DWMs have decreased their offer. Next, we analyse the profile of vendors of COVID-19 related products and vaccines. We find that most of them are specialized in a single type of listings and are willing to ship worldwide. Finally, we consider a broader set of listings mentioning COVID-19, in order to assess the general impact of the pandemic on the broader activity of DWMs. Among 10,330 such listings, we show that recreational drugs are the most affected among traditional DWMs product, with COVID-19 mentions steadily increasing since March 2020.

Inhaled corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for asthma, yet, medication adherence among patients remains poor. Shared decision-making, a patient activation strategy, can improve patient adherence to inhaled corticosteroids. This study aimed to explore whether audio-recorded patient-primary care provider encounters can be used to: 1. Evaluate the level of patient-perceived shared decision-making during the encounter, and 2. Predict levels of patient’s inhaled corticosteroid adherence. Materials and methods Shared decision-making and inhaled corticosteroid adherence were assessed using the SDM Questionnaire-9 and the Medication Adherence Report Scale for Asthma (MARS-A). Speech-to-text algorithms were used to automatically transcribe 80 audio-recorded encounters between primary care providers and asthmatic patients. Machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree) were applied to achieve the study’s predictive goals. Results The accuracy of automated speech-to-text transcription was relatively high (ROUGE F-score = .9). Machine learning algorithms achieved good predictive performance for shared decision-making (the highest F-score = .88 for the Naive Bayes) and inhaled corticosteroid adherence (the highest F-score = .87 for the Support Vector Machines). Discussion This was the first study that trained machine learning algorithms on a dataset of audio-recorded patient-primary care provider encounters to successfully evaluate the quality of SDM and predict patient inhaled corticosteroid adherence. Conclusion Machine learning approaches can help primary care providers identify patients at risk for poor medication adherence and evaluate the quality of care by measuring levels of shared decision-making. Further work should explore the replicability of our results in larger samples and additional health domains."

Its effectivity can be quantified by modifying the standard methodology for analyzing percolation and connectivity of contact networks. We apply this framework to networks with varying degree distributions, numbers of application users, and probabilities of quarantine failures. Further, we study structured populations with homophily and heterophily and the possibility of degree-targeted application distribution. Our results are based on a combination of explicit simulations and mean-field analysis. They indicate that there can be major differences in the epidemic size and epidemic probabilities which are equivalent in the normal susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) processes. Further, degree heterogeneity is seen to be especially important for the epidemic threshold but not as much for the epidemic size. The probability that tracing leads to quarantines is not as important as the application adoption rate. Finally, both strong homophily and especially heterophily with regard to application adoption can be detrimental. Overall, epidemic dynamics are very sensitive to all of the parameter values we tested out, which makes the problem of estimating the effect of digital contact tracing an inherently multidimensional problem."

The characterization of adsorbent was carried out by different techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). UV-Vis spectrophotometer was also applied to determine the amount of remaining dye in the solution. The Effect of some parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage and contact time for removal of acid blue 62 was examined and optimized at temperatures ranging from 25 to 45 0C. For determining the type of Isotherm model, Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin were used and for attaining the Thermodynamic parameters such as changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS), Vant Hoff equation were applied. Optimum values were pH of 2, contact time of 90 min and absorbent dosage of 0.03 g. The Langmuir isotherm model showed very good agreement with the equilibrium data with maximum adsorption capacity of 1000 mg/g. The thermodynamic analysis also revealed that the adsorption process was feasible, spontaneous and exothermic. The results also indicated that the adsorption of acid blue 62 onto Tannin-aminated SBA-15 follows the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Tannin@SBA-15 has a good potential for acid blue 62 dye adsorption from aqueous media."

We use the open-access database to provide descriptive evidence on the relationship between economic development and the emigration propensity of scholars. Statistical analysis using generalized additive mixed models reveals that emigration rates initially decrease as GDP per capita increases. Then, starting from around 25,000 dollars (2017 constant international dollars at purchasing power parity), the trend reverses and emigration propensity increases as countries get richer. This U-shaped pattern contrasts with what has been found in the literature for emigration rates for the general population and calls for theoretical frameworks to understand the heterogeneous responses of migration to development."

As their public health impact remains contested, little is known about PDMP user experiences and perspectives. We explore perspectives of PDMP end-users in Massachusetts. Methods Between 2016 and 2017, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews on overdose crisis dynamics and PDMP experiences with a purposive sample of 18 stakeholders (prescribers, pharmacists, law enforcement, and public health regulators). Recordings were transcribed and double-coded using a grounded hermeneutic approach. Results Perspectives on prescription monitoring as an element of overdose crisis response differed across sectors, but narratives often critiqued PDMPs as poorly conceived to serve end-user needs. Respondents indicated that PDMP: (1) lacked clear orientation towards health promotion; (2) was not optimally configured or designed as a decision support tool, resulting in confusion over interpreting data to guide health care or law enforcement actions; and, (3) problematized communication and relationships between prescribers, pharmacists, and patients. Conclusions User insights must inform design, programmatic, and policy reform to maximize PDMP benefits while minimizing harm."

 This book considers how media coverage of unexpected, dramatic events shapes public consciousness about important social and political problems. It argues that when incidents of police brutality become news, they offer one of the few real battlegrounds available for marginalized voices and activists to find a public platform and take on the powerful. Including new chapters that look more closely at race and racial justice in incidents of police force, the text reflects on the context in which the first edition was written—a time when race and policing were rarely discussed in the news or in the field of political communication—and considers what has changed in media studies since the year 2000, what hasn’t changed, and why. It considers coverage of more recent incidents of police violence and the ways in which the voices of citizen activists are treated in the news today. The text also addresses the important question of how defining political problems through such events might or might not produce more lasting policy change."

Accordingly, DPI has critical importance as it can be used in applications i.e network security or government surveillance. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey on DPI. Different from the previous studies, we try to efficiently integrate DPI techniques into network analysis mechanisms by identifying performance-limiting parameters in the analysis of modern network traffic. Analysis of the network traffic model with complex behaviors is carried out with powerful hybrid systems by combining more than one technique. Therefore, DPI methods are studied together with other techniques used in the analysis of network traffic. Security applications of DPI on Internet of Things (IoT) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architectures are discussed and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) mechanisms, in which the DPI is applied as a component of the hybrid system, are examined. In addition, methods that perform inspection of encrypted network traffic are emphasized and these methods are evaluated from the point of security, performance and functionality. Future research issues are also discussed taking into account the implementation challenges for all DPI processes."

Literacy-based paradigms are widely used to help, yet have also been widely critiqued. We conducted a study with 35 Gen Zers from across the U.S. to understand how they assess information online. We found that they tended to encounter—rather than search for—information, and that those encounters were shaped more by social motivations than by truth-seeking queries. For them, information processing is fundamentally a social practice. Gen Zers interpreted online information together, as aspirational members of social groups. Our participants sought information sensibility : a socially-informed awareness of the value of information encountered online. We outline key challenges they faced and practices they used to make sense of information. Our findings suggest that, like Gen Z’s information sensibility practices, solutions and strategies to address misinformation should also be embedded in social contexts online."
81,1da056b5eff6ca200134728935d163e8c88f9566,"Social media platforms offer their audience the possibility to reply to posts through comments and reactions. This allows social media users to express their ideas and opinions on shared content, thus opening virtual discussions. Most studies on social networks have focused only on user relationships or on the shared content, while ignoring the valuable information hidden in the digital conversations, in terms of structure of the discussion and relation between contents, which is essential for understanding online communication behavior. This work proposes a graph-based framework to assess the shape and structure of online conversations. The analysis was composed of two main stages: intent analysis and network generation. Users’ intention was detected using keyword-based classification, followed by the implementation of machine learning-based classification algorithms for uncategorized comments. Afterwards, human-in-the-loop was involved in improving the keyword-based classification. To extract essential information on social media communication patterns among the users, we built conversation graphs using a directed multigraph network and we show our model at work in two real-life experiments. The first experiment used data from a real social media challenge and it was able to categorize 90% of comments with 98% accuracy. The second experiment focused on COVID vaccine-related discussions in online forums and investigated the stance and sentiment to understand how the comments are affected by their parent discussion. Finally, the most popular online discussion patterns were mined and interpreted. We see that the dynamics obtained from conversation graphs are similar to traditional communication activities."
82,94f2a4e6a588add17c85da3e4a229cc8a98d90d2,"Increasingly taking place in online spaces, modern political conversations are typically perceived to be unproductively affirming— siloed in so called “echo chambers” of exclusively like-minded discussants. Yet, to date we lack sufficient means to measure viewpoint diversity in conversations. To this end, in this paper, we operationalize two viewpoint metrics proposed for recommender systems and adapt them to the context of social media conversations. This is the first study to apply these two metrics (Representation and Fragmentation) to real world data and to consider the implications for online conversations specifically. We apply these measures to two topics—daylight savings time (DST), which serves as a control, and the more politically polarized topic of immigration. We find that the diversity scores for both Fragmentation and Representation are lower for immigration than for DST. Further, we find that while pro-immigrant views receive consistent pushback on the platform, anti-immigrant views largely operate within echo chambers. We observe less severe yet similar patterns for DST. Taken together, Representation and Fragmentation paint a meaningful and important new picture of viewpoint diversity."
83,7f8c1bb88862e68ce9c289fa45d81a6200ae9276,"Suppressing the negative effects of grid voltage harmonics on the estimated frequency of a phase-locked loop (PLL) is a challenge in literature. This article proposes an easy-to-implement quadrature signal generator (QSG) to attenuate the oscillations on the estimated frequency in single-phase grid-connected inverters, which use second-order generalized integrator (SOGI)-PLL. It is shown that SOGI exerts a stronger filtering effect in generating the quadrature signal than the in-phase signal. Against this background, in this work, a modified integrator is introduced into the path of the in-quadrature signal to generate another in-phase component with much lower harmonic content. The proposed method imposes only a small computational burden on the existing SOGI-PLL compared to the previously presented methods that address the input voltage harmonic problem. Moreover, this method can work properly within the allowable range of grid voltage frequency deviations. The proposed integrator benefits from an error-decaying mechanism to overcome dc drift in pure integrators. The integrator has been designed based on theoretical equations. The validity of the proposed QSG and theoretical equations is evaluated using simulations and experimental studies. A fixed-point representation of the proposed QSG is also provided for implementation on low-cost microcontrollers."

Although their outcomes in the form of technical innovation are readily observed, the underlying ideas that eventually change the world are often obscured. Here, we develop a novel method that uses deep learning to unearth the markers of prescient ideas from the language used by individuals and groups. Our language-based measure identifies prescient actors and documents that prevailing methods would fail to detect. Applying our model to corpora spanning the disparate worlds of politics, law, and business, we demonstrate that it reliably detects prescient ideas in each domain. Moreover, counter to many prevailing intuitions, prescient ideas emanate from each domain’s periphery rather than its core. These findings suggest that the propensity to generate far-sighted ideas may be as much a property of contexts as of individuals."

Therefore, the study's primary purpose is to segment the organic saffron market in Mashhad, Iran using neobehavioristic theory and machine learning methods.Design/methodology/approachConsidering the neobehavioristic theory of consumer behavior, the organic saffron market was segmented using crisp and fuzzy clustering algorithms. Also, to assess the relative importance of the factors affecting the intention to buy organic saffron in each market segment, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the output of the artificial neural network (ANN). A total of 400 questionnaires were collected in Mashhad, Iran in January and February 2020.FindingsIn contrast to the belief that psychological factors are more important in market segmentation than demographic characteristics, findings showed that the demographic characteristics of consumers, especially education and income, are the dominant variables in the segmentation of the organic food market. Among the 4 A’s marketing mix elements, the results showed that a low level of awareness and accessibility are obstacles to organic saffron market development. Advertising, distribution channel improvement, package downsizing and online business development are suggested strategies for expanding the organic saffron market in Iran.Practical implicationsThe results of the present study will help policymakers and suppliers of organic saffron to identify their target markets and design short- and long-term marketing strategies to develop the organic saffron market.Originality/valueMachine learning methods and the neobehavioristic theory of consumer behavior were used to segment the organic food market."

There is abundant evidence that the bias present in training data is reﬂected in the models, or even ampliﬁed. Many previous methods for image dataset de-biasing, including models based on augmenting datasets, are computationally expensive to implement. In this study, we present a fast and effective model to de-bias an image dataset through reconstruction and minimizing the statistical dependence between intended variables. Our architecture includes a U-net to reconstruct images, combined with a pre-trained classiﬁer which penalizes the statistical dependence between target attribute and the protected attribute. We evaluate our proposed model on CelebA dataset, compare the results with a state-of-the-art de-biasing method, and show that the model achieves a promising fairness-accuracy combination."

Different aspects of autonomic computing - self configuring, self healing, self optimizing and self aware are studied for Autonomic Web Processes (AWPs) with the help of a supply chain process scenario. Existing technologies and steps needed to shorten the gap from current process management systems to AWPs are studied in this paper. The behavior of AWPs is controlled by policies defined by users. Sympathetic and parasympathetic policies are introduced to model short and long term policies. A key advantage for elevating autonomic computing to a process level is that the trade-offs can be more evident because the process components map more readily to business functions."

A submicron (∼0.15 μm)-thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) sensor film is coated on a platinum electrode through a facile aqueous dispersion. The resulting sensor reliably detected different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during the early stages of thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) even at low concentrations. The single-electrode sensor utilizes impedance spectroscopy to measure ethyl methyl carbonate and methyl formate concentrations at 5, 15, and 30 ppm independently and in various combinations using ethanol as a reference. In contrast to DC resistance measurement, which provides a single parameter, impedance spectroscopy provides a wealth of information, including impedance and phase angle at multiple frequencies as well as fitted charge transfer resistance and constant-phase elements. Different analytes influence the measurement of different parameters to varying degrees, enabling distinction using a single sensing material. The response time for ethyl methyl carbonate was measured to be 6 s. Three principal components (PCs) preserve more than 95% of information and efficiently enable discrimination of different classes of analytes. Application of low-power PEDOT:PSS-based gas sensors will facilitate cost-effective early detection of VOCs and provide early warning to battery management systems (BMS), potentially mitigating catastrophic thermal runaway events."
